# Linux unit tests for RaftMotorControl

Note that in order to use these tests some work may be needed:

- a library called Eigen is used:
- sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev
- matplotlib-cpp is used and this requires Python3 to be installed and the Makefile must reference the correct instance of Python3
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib python3-numpy
